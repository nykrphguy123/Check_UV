# Check_UV

The UV Index scale was designed to help you make informed decisions about how much time you should spend in the sun and what protection you should use. It basically tells you how strong the sun's UV rays will be.

So for all my homies out there who go outside frequently, this might be something worth looking into! 

Please please please PLEASE use sunscreen if you're going out when the UV index scale is high!
